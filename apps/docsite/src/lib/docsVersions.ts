/**
 * Version-switcher wiring for the docsite.
 *
 * The docsite ships as ONE codebase built for two content targets:
 *   - `latest`  — documents the last published release (what `npm install`
 *                 gives you today). This is the default, canonical site.
 *   - `canary`  — documents `main` (work-in-progress, unreleased).
 *
 * Both are deployed from the same code; only the package sources the build-time
 * data pipeline reads from differ (see scripts/resolve-content-root.mjs). The
 * switcher lets a reader jump between the two deploys while keeping their
 * current path, so "the same page, other version" is one click away.
 *
 * Deploy URLs are configurable via env so the same code works in production,
 * preview, and local dev. When a target's base URL is unset (e.g. local dev
 * with a single build) the switcher degrades to a no-op link to `/`.
